# Pupil Size vs. Global Brain Signal Analysis

This project aims to statistically analyze the relationship between pupil size diameter and the global brain signal over time. By leveraging Python-based analysis scripts and a comprehensive dataset, this research aims to draw meaningful insights about how the global signal can be an indicator of chaning states of mind.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. Required Python libraries and their versions are listed in the `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:



## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_github_username/your_project_name.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd fmri-pupil-size
```
3. Run the main Python script:
```bash
python .py
```

The script will process the CSV data, perform statistical analyses, and generate the corresponding output (plots, correlation matrices, etc.). You can then view the results in the designated output directory or console.

## Results

After running the scripts, the analysis results will be saved in the `results/` directory. This includes:

- Correlation matrices
- Scatter plots
- Regression results
- Statistical significance values

## Contribute

No contributions at this time.
